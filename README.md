# Diwali-sales-Analysis-
The Diwali Sales Analysis project focuses on analyzing sales data to uncover trends and insights related to the Diwali season. Using Python, the project employs essential libraries such as NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation and analysis, along with Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization. The dataset, named "Diwali Sales Data.csv", serves as the foundation for the analysis. Initial steps include loading the data, checking its dimensions, and exploring its structure using commands like df.head() and df.info() to understand the data types, missing values, and overall layout.

The project likely aims to provide insights into sales patterns, customer behavior, and performance metrics during the Diwali festival, which could help businesses in decision-making and strategy development.
